| TS-1.13 | Technical Security | Information Systems | Secure Software Development Life Cycle | Establish and regularly review a policy and process for Secure Software Development Life Cycle (SSDLC) for application design, development, deployment, to include the following:<br>• A software testing strategy<br>• Perform a code review for each release<br>• Restrict deployment of non-production testing functions into production (e.g., debug functions, flags, etc.)<br>• Scan open-source libraries<br>• Identity Access Management (IAM) to manage access to Continuous Integration (CI)/Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD) components<br>• Scanning (e.g., TFSEC) coverage for CI/CD automated pipelines and deployments (e.g., WhiteHat)<br>• Investigate and have a remediation plan for issues<br>• Do not hard code passwords, credentials, secrets, or other authentication data into source code or scripts<br>• Mask passwords and other authentication data when displayed on screen by default<br>• Obtain client approval for use of client data in non-production environments (e.g., Dev, QA, etc.)<br>• Files containing executable content are digitally signed<br>• Leverage Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Top Ten Web Application Security Risks<br>• Perform security testing when changes are made to application code (e.g., updates, enhancements, etc.)<br>• Store application security reports in an accessible repository | • Conduct an independent review of the code annually or on major releases<br>• Document and restrict the results of the code review to authorized personnel only<br>• Employ inspection relay techniques to prevent Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attacks on client and server software<br>• Test Open Source Software (OSS) and third-party software or source code for vulnerabilities<br>• Incorporate Root or Jailbreak detection<br>• Utilize code protection techniques (e.g., obfuscation, debug detection, etc.)<br><br>Reference NIST's Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF) NIST 800-218 (https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/ssdf) as an example for Threat Modeling and on how to develop a Secure Software Development Life Cycle (SSDLC) process for coverage of training, requirements, design, development, testing, release, and response. |
