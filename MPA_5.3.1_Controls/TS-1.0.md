| TS-1.0 | Technical Security | Information Systems | Data I/O Workflows & Systems | Establish and regularly review a process and workflow for Data I/O Workflows & Systems to include the following:<br>• Use dedicated (i.e., isolated) systems to move content between external networks (i.e., Internet) and internal networks (e.g., Data I/O network, production, etc.)<br>• Scan all content for viruses and malware prior to ingest onto the network<br>• Segregation of duties between Data I/O staff and other staff (e.g., production, development, etc.)<br>• Content movement is initiated from the more secure layer (e.g., push/pull content at the Data I/O zone to/from Internet; push/pull content at the production network to/from the Data I/O zone)<br>• Strict (IP and port) layer 2/3 Access Control Lists (ACLs) to allow outbound network requests from the more trusted inner layer and deny all inbound requests from the less trusted outer layers<br>• Hardware-encrypted hard drives using at least AES-256 encryption can also be used to transfer data between production networks and Data I/O systems (e.g., air gapped network)<br>• Delete content after it has been on the system for more than 24 hours<br>• When preparing or transferring content, utilize dedicated rooms with fully covered windows and closed door when work is in progress<br><br>For Applications:<br>• Data caching<br>• Use a secret vault to store user credentials | • Allowlisting to restrict content downloads and uploads to only authorized external sources and destinations<br>• Enable alerts when transfer is complete and/or downloaded<br>• Use valid DNS entry for allowlisting |
