| TS-8.1 | Technical Security | Application Security | Application Session Management | Establish and regularly review a process for Application Session Management, to include the following:<br>• Generate new session tokens upon user authentication<br>• Generate using approved industry-standard cryptographic algorithms<br>• Verify that session tokens possess at least 128-bits of entropy <br>• Securely generate session IDs<br>• Sessions automatically expire after a maximum of 15 minutes of user inactivity<br>• Initial active session tokens timeout after no more than 30 minutes (can reauthenticate in the background)<br>• URL parameters do not reveal session tokens<br>• Delete session data on client side and deactivate session data on server side once session is terminated<br>• Store session tokens in the browser using secure methods (e.g., HTML5 session storage)<br>• Encrypt session data transfers<br>• Use cookies with HTTP-only and SameSite=Strict attributes for session storage<br>• Use the "__Host-" prefix Cookie-based session tokens<br>• Detect significant changes in the session environment (e.g., new device or location, user role change, permissions change, etc.) and trigger re-authentication<br> | • Regularly rotate session IDs<br>• Enable users to log out of all active sessions across devices, providing a mechanism to terminate unauthorized sessions<br> |
