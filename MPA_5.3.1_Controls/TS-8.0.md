| TS-8.0 | Technical Security | Application Security | Application Error Handling and Logging | Establish and regularly review a policy, process, and workflow for Application Error Handling and Logging, to include the following:<br>• User error messaging does not contain system-specific information <br>• Define error messaging according to security considerations (e.g., BIA, Risk, etc.)<br>• Define exception handling according to security considerations (e.g., BIA, Risk, etc.)<br>• Utilize logging methods outlined in Security Information & Event Management Best Practices (TS-1.5) <br>• Differentiate error handling processes in development, QA, and production environments<br> | • Apply rate limiting for error responses to prevent an excessive number of errors (e.g., brute force attack)<br>• Set up monitoring to identify recurring error patterns (e.g., authentication failures, unusual HTTP error codes, etc.)<br>• Segregate error logging into different categories (e.g., security-related errors, operational errors, etc.)<br>• Encrypt logs in transit using TLS 1.2 at a minimum<br>• Encrypt logs at rest using AES-256 at a minimum |
