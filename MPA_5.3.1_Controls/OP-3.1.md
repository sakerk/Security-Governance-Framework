| OP-3.1 | Operational Security | Asset Management | High-Security Titles | Establish and regularly review a process to support the handling of content for client-classified High-Security Titles, to include the following:<br>• Aliases (e.g., AKA, working title, code name, etc.)<br>• Access limited to only authorized personnel<br>• Individual NDAs/Confidentiality Agreements<br>• Use of mobile devices is only used for business purposes, unless client approved                 <br> | • Use client-assigned security title aliases on assets and in asset tracking systems including life cycle management (e.g., handling of alias pre- vs. post-release)<br>• Communications do not include both project alias and client title together (e.g., emails, memos, etc.)<br>• Use of separate network (i.e., physical or logical segmentation)<br>• A dedicated partition on shared storage<br>• Store physical assets for High-Security Titles (e.g., scripts, art, external hard drives, etc.) in a secured area while not in use<br>• For aliases, use a generic alias that does not reference anything that might hint at the actual project or production name (e.g., characters, locations, genre, etc.)<br>• If aliases are used on any production signage, use generic signage that does not contain any artwork that might hint at the actual project or production name                             |
