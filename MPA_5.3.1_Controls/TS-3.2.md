| TS-3.2 | Technical Security | Cryptography | Encryption Key Management | Establish and regularly review a policy and process to manage Encryption Keys, to include the following:<br>• Send decryption keys, keypad PINs, and/or passwords using an out-of-band communication protocol (i.e., not on the same storage media as the content itself)<br>• Change or rotate keys at a defined cadence<br>• Grant key access to authorized personnel only<br>• Segregate key management duties from key usage | • Establish processes for the following: generation, distribution, rotation, revocation, destruction, deactivation, compromise, recovery, inventory, and backup<br>• Set up Enterprise Key Management (EKM) for managing the full life cycle for cryptographic keys including generating, using, storing, archiving, and deleting of keys<br>• Establish a Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) solution<br><br>For Key storage:<br>• Cryptographic strength of encryption key and data-encrypting key should be equal, at a minimum<br>• Store separately from the data-encrypting key<br>• Store within a secure cryptographic device (e.g., Hardware Security Module (HSM) or a PIN Transaction Security (PTS) point-of-interaction device) |
