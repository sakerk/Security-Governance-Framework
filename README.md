# Security Governance Framework (SGF)
The Security Governance Framework (SGF) is a unified set of security policies used to standardize security practices across studio, vendor, and federal compliance environments while ensuring audit readiness and operational resilience.

The **Security Governance Framework (SGF)** is a unified set of security policies, mapped to **NIST 800-171 Rev.3** and **MPA Content Security Best Practices v5.3.1**.  
It provides a structured foundation for:

**Policies** – clearly defined security requirements  
**Assessments** – alignment with audit and compliance objectives  
**Documentation** – evidence, logs, and records for each control family  
**Governance** – oversight, accountability, and continuous improvement  

This repository contains all core SGF policies, organized by control family, with short summaries and links to supporting standards, SOPs, and required documentation.
